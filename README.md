- Create a virtual environment

Virtual environment isolates our project. Anything we install within the virtual environment does not affect the rest of the computer and vice-versa.

```
vitualenv . (to install virtual environment)
```
then activate the virtual environment by:
```
source Scripts/activate
```
then create django project
```
django-admin startproject <project-name>
```
then make an app
```
python manage.py startapp <app-name>
```
then enjoy creating app
